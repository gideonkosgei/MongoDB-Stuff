1.      Less mature
        RDBMSs have been around a lot longer than NoSQL databases.        
        With the advancement of years RDBMSs have matured to become richly functional and stable systems.
        In contrast, most of the NoSQL database alternatives have just barely made it out of the pre-production stages, 
        and there are many important features that have not yet been implemented. 
        
2.     Less support
       All enterprises need to have the reassurance that should a key function within their data management system fail, 
       they will have access to competent support in a timely manner. 
       All the RDMBS vendors have made great effort to ensure that such services are available, and enterprises can also enlist
       24 hour support from remote database administration services, which have the expertise to handle most of the RDBMSs.

3.     Administration
       The end goal for NoSQL database design was to offer a solution that would require no administration, but the reality on the ground is much different.
       NoSQL databases still demand a lot of technical skill with both installation and maintenance.

4.     No advanced expertise
       Because NoSQL databases are still new, virtually every NoSQL developer out there is still learning the ropes, unlike RDBMS systems, which have millions of proficient developers 
       throughout the market and in every field of trade. Over time, this situation will resolve itself, but presently, it remains easier to find an RDBMS expert than a NoSQL expert.
