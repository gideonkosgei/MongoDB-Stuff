Advantages of MongoDB over RDBMS
--------------------------------
1. Schema less − MongoDB is a document database in which one collection holds different documents.
2. Number of fields, content and size of the document can differ from one document to another.
3. Structure of a single object is clear.
4. No complex joins.
5. Deep query-ability. MongoDB supports dynamic queries on documents using a document-based query language that's nearly as powerful as SQL.
6. Tuning.
7. Ease of scale-out − MongoDB is easy to scale.
8. Conversion/mapping of application objects to database objects not needed.
9. Uses internal memory for storing the working set, enabling faster access of data.

Advantages of NoSQL databases
Regardless of these obstacles, NoSQL databases have been widely adopted in many enterprises for the following reasons:

1.      Elastic scalability
        RDBMSs are not as easy to scale out on commodity clusters, whereas NoSQL databases are made for transparent expansion, taking advantage of new nodes. 
        These databases are designed for use with low-cost commodity hardware. 
        In a world where upward scalability is being replaced by outward scalability, NoSQL databases are a better fit.

2.      Big data applications
        Given that transaction rates are growing from recognition, there is need to store massive volumes of data. 
        While RDBMSs have grown to match the growing needs, but it’s difficult to realistically use one RDBMS to manage such data volumes. 
        These volumes are however easily handled by NoSQL databases.

3.      Database administration
        The best RDBMSs require the services of expensive administrators to design, install and maintain the systems. 
        On the other hand, NoSQL databases require much less hands-on management, with data distribution and auto repair capabilities, 
        simplified data models and fewer tuning and administration requirements. However, in practice, someone will always be needed to take care of performance and availability of databases.

4.      Economy
        RDBMSs require installation of expensive storage systems and proprietary servers, while NoSQL databases can be easily installed in cheap commodity 
        hardware clusters as transaction and data volumes increase. This means that you can process and store more data at much less cost.
